      "1": "We started this manufacturing business because my father saw an opportunity to create something lasting for our family. The original heartbeat was about building quality products that we could be proud of while creating jobs in our community. Even today, that same drive to create value for our customers and provide for our family keeps us going. It's not just about profit—it's about legacy and impact.",
      "2": "I would tell them that our business represents three generations of hard work, innovation, and commitment to excellence. We own this business because it allows us to control our destiny, support our community, and create opportunities for future generations. It's our way of making a meaningful contribution to the world while building something that can outlast any one of us.",
      "3": "Integrity is non-negotiable—we never compromise on quality or honest dealing with customers. Family comes first, but that doesn't mean family members get a free pass in the business. We value hard work, continuous learning, and treating all employees with respect. These principles have guided us through economic downturns and will continue to be our north star."

      "4": "I want us to keep this restaurant business for generations, but only if the next generation is truly passionate about it. We're not just in the food business—we're in the business of creating experiences and memories. If my children want to carry this forward, I'll support them completely. If not, we should sell to someone who shares our values and will treat our employees well.",
      "5": "I see myself transitioning from operator to more of a strategic advisor role over the next 10 years. I want to remain involved in major decisions and mentor the next generation, but I don't need to be in the day-to-day operations forever. I think I'd be most valuable as someone who preserves the culture and values while letting fresh ideas flourish.",
      "6": "Ownership should be limited to direct descendants who have worked in the business for at least 5 years and demonstrated commitment. Spouses can be involved in operations but not ownership unless they've been part of the family for over 10 years. We need to protect the business from potential divorce situations while still honoring family members who truly contribute."

    "4": {
      "7": "I sit primarily in the Business and Ownership circles, with strong Family ties. As President, I'm deeply involved in operations while also being a significant owner. Sometimes I struggle with separating these roles, especially when making decisions that affect family members. I need to get clearer about when I'm wearing which hat.",
      "8": "Honestly, we're hoping things work out more than we have a clear plan. We've talked about succession, but we haven't formalized anything or had the tough conversations about who's ready to lead. This is probably our biggest vulnerability right now. We need to create a structured process for leadership transition.",
      "9": "I expect family members to earn their positions through competence and commitment, not just bloodline. I think they expect me to create opportunities for them, but also to be fair about performance standards. There's probably some tension around whether family gets special treatment, and we need to address this more directly."

      "10": "The biggest threat is probably the rapid pace of technological change. If we can't keep innovating and adapting, we'll become irrelevant. There's also the risk that the next generation might not be interested in technology or might want to take the company in a completely different direction than what made us successful.",
      "11": "We're strong on technical skills and innovation—that's always been our edge. We're vulnerable when it comes to formal business processes and financial management. Our relationships are good but informal, which works now but might not scale. We need better systems and more structured communication as we grow.",
      "12": "Right now, I make most of the tough calls, sometimes in consultation with my wife and brother. It's working because we're still small, but it's not sustainable. We need a clearer governance structure that defines who decides what, and we need to document our decision-making processes better."
